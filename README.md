# Simple DAO Voting

A fully functional, flat-structure DAO governance system. This repository demonstrates how to build a voting mechanism where voting power is determined by the number of tokens a user holds.

## Features
- **Governance Token (GT):** An ERC-20 token used for voting weight.
- **Proposal System:** Any token holder can create a proposal.
- **Weighted Voting:** 1 Token = 1 Vote.
- **Vote Tracking:** Prevents double voting on the same proposal.
- **Execution Status:** Tracks whether a proposal has been executed.

## Quick Start

1. **Install:**
   ```bash
   npm install
YOLO badge test 😆
